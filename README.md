# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses the classic [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to predict the survival of passengers based on various features like age, sex, class, and fare. This repository contains a Python script for data preprocessing and initial model training using `scikit-learn`.

## Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning competitions. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on information such as gender, class, age, and fare.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on the [Kaggle Titanic competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` and place them in the project directory.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main libraries used are:
- `pandas` for data handling
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Usage
To run the script, make sure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in the same directory as `titanic.py`. Then execute:

```bash
python titanic.py
```

The script performs:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant columns and fills missing values.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Maps categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) to numeric values.
3. **Model Training**: Uses linear regression (and potentially other models) to predict survival.

## Modeling and Features
- **Features Used**: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`
- **Preprocessing**: Missing values in `Age` and `Fare` are filled with the mean, and categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked` are encoded as numeric values.
- **Model**: The script currently utilizes linear regression, but other models can be tested for improved accuracy.

## Results
Once the model is trained, predictions on the test set will be output, which can then be submitted to Kaggle for evaluation.
