# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains a solution for the [Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition. The objective of this competition is to predict the survival of passengers based on characteristics like age, gender, class, and fare. This repository's approach uses logistic regression for binary classification.

## Project Overview
The Titanic competition is a classic beginner project for understanding machine learning workflows, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Generating predictions for submission.

## Data Preprocessing
The script preprocesses the Titanic dataset by:
1. Removing unnecessary columns (`Cabin`, `Name`, `Ticket`).
2. Handling missing values in `Embarked`, `Age`, and `Fare` columns.
3. Encoding categorical variables (e.g., mapping `male`/`female` to 1/2).

## Modeling Approach
A **Logistic Regression** model is used in this project:
- **Features**: `PassengerId`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`.
- **Model Training**: The data is split into training and testing subsets with `train_test_split`.
- **Evaluation**: After training, predictions are made on the test dataset, and results are formatted for Kaggle submission.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### File Structure
```plaintext
.
├── titanic.py          # Main script for preprocessing, training, and submission
├── train.csv           # Training dataset
├── test.csv            # Test dataset
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Usage
1. Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the repository folder.
2. Run the `titanic.py` script:
   ```bash
   python titanic.py
   ```
3. The output will be a CSV file (`submission.csv`) with predictions, ready for Kaggle submission.

## Results
This logistic regression model provides a baseline for further improvement. Future enhancements could involve using more complex models, hyperparameter tuning, or feature engineering to improve predictive accuracy.
